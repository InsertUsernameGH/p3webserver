# p3webserver
A (free to use) webserver I created because my dad said it's difficult to make a webserver. Spoiler: it isn't.

# Installing
Just download the files, put them into a folder of your choice, and run the "server.py" script. The webserver will ask for a port - if you don't need to change this, just hit Enter. (If you do need to change it, type your new port and hit Enter)
Then, type "localhost" (without quotes) followed by a colon and your port number (":8080" is the default). Hit Enter, and you'll see the index.html page.

I hope this can be useful to someone. I think you can connect to it from outside your network, but it's kinda complicated. I suggest just using this if you just want a network file system and you don't care about connecting from a different network.

# Allowed uses
This webserver is completely free to use, for either commercial or home use. You may modify the code for any reason.

I hope this will be useful!
